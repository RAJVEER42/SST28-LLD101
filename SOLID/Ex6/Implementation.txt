According to Readme.md file it is clearly mentioned that this code is violating the LSP principle, and how it is violating
is the parent which is the NotificationSender class, always expects the Notification from it's child class.

Now the children: SmsSender, WhatsAppSender, EmailSender each of them are behaving differently and thus breaking the LSP principle.
For the SmsSender it ignores subject, thus the design of this is inconsistent, as the parent expects a complete
message , but here it is not passing the subject.

For the WhatsAppSender there is a precondition, that the phone number should begin with + and condition like this is not mentioned
anywhere and also the parent expects the result, not any argument exception, thus this is also breaking the behavior the parent expects.

And for the EmailSender it is truncating the response by applying a precondition which is something that shows data loss.

Thus changing each of them by defining what we actually want in the parent class and implementing in that way in the child class.
1. SmsSender : Added the subject explicitly to show the consistent behavior
2. WhatsAppSender: Removed the precondition check as the parent did not expect any exception
3. EmailSender: Removed the precondition of the length, as there is a data loss by truncating the message.
