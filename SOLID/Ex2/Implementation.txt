According to the Readme.md file, it is clearly mentioned that the CafeteriaSystem do all the tasks by itself.

Thus there are different things that this service method is doing which can be separated:
- harcoded tax rules, discount rules and file storage.
- tax and discount computations (all the arithmetic stuffs)
- printing/Output
- invoice formatting

So breaking down the CafeteriaSystem step by step:

1. TaxPolicy : created this interface because the tax rules are harcoded, and the CafeteriaSystem completely
depends on this tax rules, if some different tax rule introduce in future then we have to add this if, else cases 
with the types - not a good design.

Thus this interface will take care of every new class created in future, we just have to change the constructor in the 
Main class that's it, the method will be same and we will implement a new class for that tax rule and the logic inside it.

As you can see we have implemented different files for StudentTaxPolicy and StaffTaxPolicy

2. Discount Policy: same reason just like the TaxPolicy , as the discount rules are hardcoded as well, we have make different files 
accordingly

Ex: StaffDiscountPolicy , StudentDiscountPolicy etc.

3. PricingCalculator: This is created because, we can see that the CafeteriaSystem calculates the tax and discount inside,
so removed this calculation in this pricing calculator which calculates  all the things: total, subtotal, tax percentage, tax amount,
discount.

And created an object called PricingBreakdown, which includes all of these fields thus it becomes easy we can pass this object and use 
all the fields which we need thus taking care of all the arithmetic operations.

4. InvoiceStore: create this interface because of the persistence on the DB as we have file store now we can use this one interface

So initially the CafeteriaSystem depends on the File store, if in future we decide to move to the Database like MySQL, then we have to change
the CafeteriaSystem file as well
By creating this interface this becomes easy we just have to change the object declaration by adding a new class.

5. InvoiceFormatter: this class already exists in the file system but not functional, remove all the formatting logic from the 
CafeteriaSystem and moved inside this class to take care of thus this class's single responsibility is to take care of the formatting of the invoice.

6. InvoicePresenter: this might be a take like if i include this in the CafeteriaSystem then it is a simple approach, where the CafeteriaSystem is responsible
for the workflow and printing.

But i thought just like the previous assignment moving the priting logic into a different class will make more sense.
