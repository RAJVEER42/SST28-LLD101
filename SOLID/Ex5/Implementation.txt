According to Readme.md file it is clearly mentioned that this code is violating the LSP principle, and how it is violating
is the parent which is the Exporter class, always expects the Export Result from it's child class.

Now the children: PdfExporter, CsvExporter, JsonExporter each of them are behaving differently and thus breaking the LSP principle.
For the PdfExporter it checks the condition of the length and throw exception which is not expected by the parent class,
similarly for the CsvExporter: it is converting the data, or simple losing the meaning of the data, thus it is not reliable as it is 
changing the whole meaning,
for example:
if the input is Hello, World! then  the output is Hello World!, missed the comma

Similalry for the JsonExporter, if the req is null then that function is silently crashing, which is again not expected by the parent class.

Thus changing each of them by defining what we actually want in the parent class and implementing in that way in the child class.

1. Pdfexporter :  removed the precondition check of the length
2. CsvExporter: instead of removing the characters escaping them, thus the meaning remains as it is.
3. JsonExporter: instead of crashing(returning empty json output), it is returning the default condition.
