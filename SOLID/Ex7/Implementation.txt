As it is mentioned in the readme file only , the SmartClassroomDevice is an interface with all the methods
and we consider this as the fat interface.

This is because all the classes that implements this interface, don't need all the methods inside them, but as they are
implementing SmartClassroomDevice they have to implement that irrelevant methods.

Here are the changes that we have done:
1. Powerable.java: So rather than having the power on and power off function inside the SmartClassroomDevice, we have created
this as the separate interface thus the classes that needs this methods uses these methods only.

2. BrightnessControllable.java: We have removed the setBrightness function from the SmartClassroomDevice and added
inside this BrightnessControllable

3. TemperatureControllable.java: We have removed the setTemperature function from the SmartClassroomDevice and added
inside this TemperatureControllable

4. AttendanceScannable: We have removed the scanAttendance function from the SmartClassroomDevice and added inside this
AttendanceScannable

5. Now the files like Projector, LightsPanel, AirConditioner, AttendanceScanner will implement this interfaces that we have 
built, and removed the SmartClassroomDevice as it is no more needed.

6. DeviceRegistry: Initially when we have this SmartClassroomDevice, the DeviceRegistry contains that only, so removed that
and changed to Object type, and used the <T> which is the java generic as we don't know which interface will be returned.

7. ClassroomController: removed the SmartClassroomDevice and added the interfaces which are needed.
