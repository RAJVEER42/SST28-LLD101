According to the Readme.md file, it is clearly mentioned that the OnboardingService do all the tasks by itself.

Thus there are different things that this service method is doing which can be separated:
- Input Parsing
- Validation
- ID Generation
- Data Assembly
- Persistence in the DB
- Output/Printing

So breaking down the OnboardingService step by step:

1. RawInputParser : This class will only take care of the parsing, so we will pass the raw input 
in the method of this class and pass the logic of the parsing, in the parse() method, which will take the 
raw string and returns the Map<String, String>

This method is static so we can directly call this using the class no need to create any object for this.
Because this does not depends any object variable only a string input and performing the task that's it.

2. StudentValidator : This class will only take care of the validation of the Map, that we have returned
from the RawInputParser.parse() method, and it will return an ArrayList of string which includes the 
errors inside it.

The method is static again, and also we are passing the kv map as the input in this validates method, to extract the things.

3. Created a StudentRepository interface, with the save and the count methods, as we no need to expose
the methods of the FakeDb to the OnboardingService class.

Thus it includes the save and the count method and we will implement this interface in the FakeDb class.
The logic is already written in the FakeDb to implement these methods.

Also why have we used this interface upon the class is because, we just want implement what to do, not how to do it
If in future if we decide to implement a different type of storage then we have to change the class and also the implementation
of that class in the service which will violate the open/closed principle.

4. OnboardingPresenter: This class will take care of all the types of printing, so it will have three static methods:
one for printing input, one for printing errors and one fore printing success.

And we will replace the logic of printing things from the OnboardingService into the OnboardingPresenter class.

For the goals:
Added one more string to validates the output that if we passes something invalid then what does it shows.
And for the hardcoded programs, we created a ProgramRegistry class with the methods like isValid, getAllowed program as well
to get the programs and use these methods instead of hardcoding them into the StudentValidator class.
