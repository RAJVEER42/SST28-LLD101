This is an another problem violation ISP - Interface Segregation principle.
So as mentioned in the readme file we have this ClubAdminTools interface, all in one as it includes
finance operations, minuts operations, event operations.

Now the the files like TreasurerTool, SecretaryTool , EventLeadTool implements this one fat interface and that 
is ClubAdminTools, but as we can see the name of the files all of them have different purposes.

TreasurerTool is for finance operations like adding income or expenses.
EventLeadTool is for event operations performing methods like creating event and getting the count of the event.
SecretaryTool is for the minutes operations.

But as they implement the ClubAdminTools they have to implement the other methods which is not needed for them.

Thus we have break down the ClubAdminTools interface into 3 different interfaces, for their respective purposes.

FinanceOperations: This interface will take care about the things related to the finances.
MinutesOperations: This interface will take care about the things related to the secretary ops.
EventOperations: This interface will take care about the things related to the events.

Thus rather than implementing one single interface ClubAdminTools, we will use this interfaces wherver is need for their
respective purposes.

Changed TreasurerTool, EventLeadTool, SecretaryTool to implement these interfaces.

And mainly changed the ClubConsole file as it is using ClubAdminTools, we have changed with these new interfaces.
